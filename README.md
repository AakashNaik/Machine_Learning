# Machine_Learning
this are the assignments submitted for the machine learning course at IIT Kharagpur. We have to build a basic prototype of existing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression,linear regression,decision tree etc.

for decison tree-

README_____________________________________________
Use decisiontree.py for 1st and decisiontree1.py for 2nd question
In each code split_data1 is used for the gini index calculation and splitting while split_data2 is
used for information gain calculation
Accuracy code is provided in decisiontree2.py for calculating accuracy of both the models
Test function must be called for test cases it takes one test case at a time and prints the result
Rest of the code is self explanatory
